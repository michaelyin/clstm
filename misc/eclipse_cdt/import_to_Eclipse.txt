1. Importing the project into Eclipse

- Click "File | New | Makefile Project with Existing Code". Into "Existing code location", use the path of clstm sources. 
Don't forget to choose a toolchain for indexing (e.g. Linux Toolchain)

2. Setting the build command to Scons

Right-click on the clstm project (inside the project explorer). Select the "Properties" entry from the dropdown menu, then select "C/C++ Build" in the Properties window 
and type "scons" inside the "Build Command" text field. Then press Ok.

3. Adding libraries to the project

If Eclipse don't automatically find the libraries (resulting in not finding symbols), right click the project (inside the project explorer), 
then select "C/C++ general | Paths & Symbols" and inside the tab named "Includes" select "GNU/C++", then press the "Add" button. 
Select "Filesystem", then enter the correct path to Wesnoth dependencies (e.g. /usr/include/SDL, /usr/include/pango-1.0). 
After this operation Eclipse should ask you if you want to rebuild the source index (say yes). 

4. configure Eclipse syntax parser

Window -> Preferences -> C/C++ -> Build -> Settings -> Discovery -> CDT GCC Build-in Compiler Settings

in the text box entitled Command to get compiler specs append -std=c++11 (see screen shot cplusplus-2011.png)
